# Depth map using stereo imaging

## overview
this is useful in various odometry application in which camera can be used as sensor and depth can be used as a feature for localization and state estimation.
stereo imaging is based on the imaging using two camera setup.and by knowing the camera callibration of these camera 3d world can be constructed using different 2d images
